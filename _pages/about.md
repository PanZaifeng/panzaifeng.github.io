Hi there!
I'm a Ph.D. student at UC San Diego, starting from Fall 2024. I'm part of the PICASSO Lab, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yufei Ding](https://picassolab.squarespace.com/yufei). My current research interests lie in machine learning systems, with a particular focus on making large language models (LLMs) more efficient from the perspectives of systems, compilers, and kernels, covering both inference and training.

Before my Ph.D., I earned my Master’s degree at Renmin University of China, advised by Prof. [Feng Zhang](https://fengzhangcs.github.io) and working closely with Dr. [Zhen Zheng](https://jamesthez.github.io). My Master’s research focused on ML compilers for optimizing workloads on GPUs, with an emphasis on industrial recommendation models (see my publications at ASPLOS’23 and SC’24).

My Chinese name is 潘再峰. I also like being called 小再. If you’re interested in my research or just want to connect as a friend, feel free to email me at [zapan@ucsd.edu](mailto:zapan@ucsd.edu).

Also, shout-out to my roommate, who is an expert in computer architecture—check out his [homepage](https://zhongkaiyu.github.io) and research!
